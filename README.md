# MAQE Homework Challenge - Template and Styling
Time: 40 - 60 minutes recommended.

Recreate the following reference image in HTML and CSS using a templating library.

Requirements
You can use any markup, styles and layout method necessary, but you must use these JSON files as your data source:
authors
posts
You must use a template library. Either a standalone library or one that is a part of a framework.
Links do not have to function at all. Any links in the image are for display only.
Don't worry about browser support. If it can run on the latest version of Google Chrome, it's fine.
Programming Language
If you are applying as a Back End Engineer definitely use a back end language. (MAQE uses PHP and NodeJS primarily, but feel free to use whichever language you're most comfortable with.) Frameworks are OK too.

If you are applying as a Front End Engineer please use Javascript and a JS templating library (like Handlebars.js, etc.) Frameworks are OK too.

If you are applying as a a Fullstack Engineer feel free to do one or both of the above.
